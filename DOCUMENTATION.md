#### High-Level Architecture
```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Presentation  │    │   Application   │    │     Storage     │
│     Layer       │◄──►│     Layer       │◄──►│     Layer       │
│  (React UI)     │    │  (State Mgmt)   │    │ (localStorage)  │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

#### Component Architecture
```
App
├── TodoHeader
├── TodoInput
├── TodoFilters
├── TodoList
│   └── TodoItem
└── TodoStats
```

### 2.2 Data Design

#### Todo Item Structure
```typescript
interface Todo {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  completed: boolean;
  priority: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  dueDate?: Date;
}
```

#### Application State
```typescript
interface AppState {
  todos: Todo[];
  filter: 'all' | 'active' | 'completed';
  searchQuery: string;
}
```

### 2.3 UI/UX Design

#### Design Principles
- **Simplicity**: Clean, minimalist interface
- **Accessibility**: High contrast, keyboard navigation
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first design approach
- **Feedback**: Clear visual feedback for user actions

#### Color Scheme
- Primary: Blue (#5b7cf7)
- Success: Green (#10b981)
- Warning: Yellow (#f59e0b)
- Danger: Red (#ef4444)
- Neutral: Gray scale

#### Typography
- Primary Font: System font stack
- Headings: Bold, larger sizes
- Body: Regular weight, readable sizes

### 2.4 Technical Design
